Performed high-fidelity CFD simulations using Ansys Fluent and Fensap on a three-element high lifting airfoil (McDonnell Douglas MDA
 30P30N) under conditions of M = 0.2, Re = 9 million, and α = 8◦ to study the effect of slat/flap positioning on ice accretion and
 aerodynamic performance– Validated the computational model against literature for Cl, Cp for air solver, droplet collection efficiency, and ice shapes; used the Sobol
 sequence sampling method to generate design points for simulations across 12 different slat and flap locations– Findings indicate that maximum lift is achieved with low flap overhang and higher flap gap, while drag increases significantly with larger
 slat gaps
